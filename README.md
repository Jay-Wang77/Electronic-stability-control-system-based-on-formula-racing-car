# Electronic-stability-control-system-based-on-formula-racing-car

* Developing the ABS control system and TCS traction control system on the MK100 hardware device based on the principles of finite state machines and the PID control algorithm.

* The system is divided into two operating conditions according to the actual needs of the race car: start-up condition and cornering condition.

* The entire system is modeled in Simulink and Stateflow, split into three different stages: data processing, logic control, and execution, each stage is designed to perform specific functions to ensure optimal control performance.

* The systemâ€™s robust performance was verified through simulation tests in Carsim and real-vehicle tests on a Formula car under actual racing conditions.
